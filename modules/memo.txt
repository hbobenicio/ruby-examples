Modules are useful to agregate common functions in a namespace.

They are used in mixins functionality too, so their instance methods
could also become instance methods on classes that include them.

Modules can have instance methods and "module"s methods. Only instance methods are used in mixins. Only modules methods are used like function namespaces
